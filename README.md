# CTDGFinder

This is a Python implementation of the CTDGFinder algorithm. Its purpose is to identify clusters of gene duplicates across annotated genomes. For more information about how the algorithm works, see its associated [publication](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/34/1/215/2655122). For instructions see the [manual](manual/manual.md) and follow the [preprocessing steps](manual/preprocessing.md) to build the files needed to run CTDGFinder.
